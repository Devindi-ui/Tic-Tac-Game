# Test Strategy

## Testing Approach
1. Risk-Based Testing: Focus on critical game logic first
2. Shift-left Testing: Test early and often
3. Automation First: Automate repetitive tests
4. Continuous Testing: Integrate with development workflow

## Test Types Priority
1. High Priority - Game logic, winning condition
2. Medium Priority - Audio issue, UI interaction
3. Low Priority - animation, visual styling

## Test Types Severity
1. Critical Severity - Game board crash
2. High Severity - Game buttons not working
3. Medium Severity - show wrong status text
4. Low Severity - Wrong game title
